# MinorProjects

Included in this folder are mini-projects. I am using this as an opportunity to create R scripts that solve certain problems and create something that can be digested by other users. The main goal of all of this is to find employment as a data analyst who uses R as a core skill. Projects that are more geared toward analysis will be in a different folder but for now I like posting little mini-projects that demonstrate competency in R, ability to use R to do actual stuff and the ability to write code that humans can understand.
